##  pnflow - classical pore-network (extraction and) flow simulation

This repository hosts the classical network flow simulation code called pnflow. 
[pnextract network extraction code](https://github.com/aliraeini/pnextract) is also included [here](src/pnm/pnextract) for convenience.


 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 
## See [src/pnm](src/pnm) and [doc](doc) for details on pnflow code.

## See [src/script/README.md](src/script/README.md) for compile/build instructions.

See also README files for other modules which are located in their own directories:    
[src/libvoxel](src/libvoxel), [src/script](src/script) and in [thirdparty](thirdparty).
